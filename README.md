## Adding more feature in future

I will add more advance feature to it, after some time. Some of them are: -

- Multiple Game Modes:
          
          Classic Mode: The traditional Simon game where players repeat sequences.
          Speed Mode: Players must repeat sequences within a shorter time limit.
          Memory Mode: Sequences are shown once, and players must remember and repeat them after a delay.
          Multiplayer Mode: Allow multiple players to compete against each other.
          
- Difficulty Levels:
          
          Implement different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that adjust the speed of the sequences and the length of the initial sequence.

- Customizable Themes:

          Allow users to choose different themes for the game, such as different color schemes, sound effects, and backgrounds.

- Leaderboard and Achievements:

          Add a leaderboard to track high scores and achievements to reward players for reaching certain milestones.
